                    <p class="card-text">William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner Sr. is a fictional pirate in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film series. Although he is only mentioned in the first film, he appears in the first two sequels, portrayed by Stellan Skarsg√•rd.[1][2]

                            Marine flora and fauna encrust Bootstrap as he is gradually transformed by the aquatic environment in which he now lives. The longer anyone serves aboard the Flying Dutchman, the more his human-like features become extinguished as they are replaced by sea life. Bootstrap's humanity remains more visible than those of the other crew members; presumably he is one of the most recent additions to Davy Jones's crew.
                            
                            "Bootstrap Bill" Turner was the only member of Jones' crew that was not created digitally.[3] His appearance was achieved with prosthetics and makeup. </p>
